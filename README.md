# serverhiccups

Hi, I'm serverhiccups!

I'm a front-end developer with an interest in all things computers. I generally work with language 🗣️, Preact ⚛️ and Typescript ⌨️.

Currently I'm working on [tallskog](https://github.com), a web native app for creating, editing and exploring (linguistic) syntax trees.

I can be reached at _hiccup (at) hiccup01 dot com_.

Below you can see a selection of my work!
